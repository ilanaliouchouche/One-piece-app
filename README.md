# OP-CNN

## Overview

"OP-CNN" is a deep learning project designed to recognize characters from the anime "One Piece" using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). 
This project leverages a pre-trained CNN (MobileNet), which is fine-tuned on a dataset of "One Piece" character images. Developed using Keras, the model is saved and ready to be deployed in an API for easy integration and usage.

This project aims to demonstrate the capabilities of transfer learning by using a pre-trained CNN and adapting it to recognize specific characters from "One Piece." By fine-tuning the model on a targeted dataset, 
I achieve high accuracy in character recognition (0.99 in val set).

The project was done in python with keras.
